# project1_cpp_2025
Project for the second semester in uni. It contains basic use of c++ to create an app that handles and organizes participants with the use of linked lists. The project was done for the class of data structures and algorithms.

- Project Overview

This project is a C++ implementation of a singly linked list for managing participant data. The system allows users to load, sort, search, modify, and delete participants based on different criteria such as ID, ranking, and timestamps.

- Key Features:
1. Load participant data from a file.
2. Sort and manage participants based on ID, ranking, and timestamp.
3. Delete participants individually or clear the entire list.
4. Search for a participant by name.
5. Print participant details in different orders.

- Technologies Used

1. C++ for object-oriented programming and memory management.
2. File Handling for reading and storing participant data.

-> How to Use

- Menu Options:
1. Read players from a file in order of appearance.
2. Read players from a file sorted by ID.
3. Sort the list based on player ranking.
4. Delete a player by ID.
5. Delete the entire player list.
6. Search for a player by name.
7. Print the player list in its current order.
8. Print the player list based on registration timestamp.
9. Exit the program.

- Detailed Functionality:

1. Reading players from a file: Loads participants into the linked list from a given file.
2. Sorting by ID or ranking: Ensures data is ordered for easy access.
3. Deleting participants: Users can remove individual participants by ID or delete the entire list.
4. Searching: Allows quick lookup of a participantâ€™s details using their name.
5. Printing participant lists: Displays data in different orders, either as stored or based on timestamp.
